# five38clubrankings

This package just grabs the table located at https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/global-club-soccer-rankings/', and additionally does some summary by league and country. You can get the csv at https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/soccer-spi, but that doesn't have country or one-week change. The main function is `get_club_rankings`.
